Java, Gradle, Maven, Webpack, Angular, React, VueJS, Security, Caching viele Konfigurationen, vieles um Fehler zu machen

In der Regel einfach zu lange.

=== What is JHipster?

* Full Stack Application Development Platform
* 100% Open Source 
* Best Practice & High Quality Code
* Community & Knowledge

[NOTE.speaker]
--
All is open source at github our mailing list
fun fact last week a collegue was looking for something spring boot related and ended up at our documentation
with exactly what he wanted to know

=== Goals

[quote]
icon:quote-left[2x] A high-performance and robust Java stack on the server side with Spring Boot
[quote.fragment]
icon:quote-left[2x] A sleek, modern, mobile-first front-end with Angular, React and Bootstrap
[quote.fragment]
icon:quote-left[2x] A powerful workflow to build your application with Yeoman, Webpack and Maven/Gradle

[NOTE.speaker]
--
In particular the workflow is very important. We try to ease development and make the pain go away
when it comes to e.g. configuration of webpack + maven 
--

[.blue.background]
[.white.text]
=== Policies

[quote]
icon:quote-left[2x] technologies used by JHipster have their default configuration used as much as possible

[quote.fragment]
icon:quote-left[2x] only add options when there is sufficient added-value in the generated code

[quote.fragment]
icon:quote-left[2x] for the Java code, follow the default Intellij IDEA coding style*

[quote.fragment]
icon:quote-left[2x] use strict versions for third-party libraries

[NOTE.speaker]
--
For example, we use JPA, Spring, Angular and React the “usual way”, without some heavy configuration options and with their usual naming and coding conventions. We do this as:

Each technology usually has a very good reason to have those defaults
It’s much easier to understand how JHipster works if we don’t re-configure everything

We might only change a default configuration if it produces some issue with the other technologies used by JHipster. For example, to have Spring Security and Angular working together, we had to change Spring Security’s default configuration.

Speaking about formatting...
Wie ist das in der JS welt? macht man sich da noch Gedanken uber formatting?

Well eher nicht, dank prettier. Bald auch in einem Java Projekt bei euch um die Ecke...

Not yet final, but already useable, but of course opionated, but thats what prettier is doing
--> No discussion about formatting anymore

Let's Code

=== Gettin' Started

----
//Install node, java and git (optional)
npm install -g generator-jhipster
npm install -g generator-jhipster-vuejs

jhipster --blueprints vuejs
----

[NOTE.speaker]
--
we recommend adoptopenjdk 11 and node lts version
Latest version 6.6.0 (Gradle 6, Azure Spring Cloud, Swagger UI3)
--

=== Demo

* Generate a basic library application
* Short Walkthrough
* Generare CRUD capabilities
* Small changes to the code
* Build with Gitlab CI, deploy to Heroku

=== Side-by-Side Approach

[source,java]
----
@SuppressWarnings("unused")
@Repository
public interface BorrowRepository extends JpaRepository<Borrow, Long> {

}

@SuppressWarnings("unused")
@Repository
public interface BorrowRepositoryCustom extends BorrowRepository {
	
}

While it is generating, most people are interested in how to have custom code and
business relevant code while keeping up2date with jhipster
This helps to keep custom and generated code totally separated. Similar approach possible with angular (thanks to typescript)
--

=== Side-by-Side Approach


[source,typescript]
----
import BookCopyService from "@/entities/book-copy/book-copy.service";

export default class BookCopyServiceCustom extends BookCopyService {
	
}

Antonios Slides from first jhipster conf. The Devoxx Team and him has changed the whole devoxx conference 
backend to jhipster based microservices and side by side approach in general with angular

Blog series about how to have a custom ui without interfering with the generated code too much
--

=== Going to Production

* Start with less
* Don't touch the generated code
* Keep JDL up to date
* Use same DB in Dev & Prod
** https://atomfrede.gitlab.io/2019/05/jhipster-with-testcontainers/[Integrate Testcontainers]
* Use DTO & Services
* Most likely you will add custom web api

== Future Plans

* Polyglot 
** Kotlin icon:check-square-o[]
** Node.js, .net icon:battery-3[]
** Micronaut, Quarkus icon:battery-2[]
* Spring Boot 2.2.x icon:check-square-o[]
* Neo4j Support icon:battery-3[]
* Modulith, Microfrontends, Fully Reactive

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Kotlin quite simple, just replaces java with kotin
node in beta stage .net in beta stage
Quarkus/Micronaut in proof of concept phase working together with the micronaut team
Boot 2.2 is in master, took a little longer due to spring cloud
Worked together with michael simons from the neo team, waiting SDN/RX release to get a merge request
Modulith for better structure, Reactive with reactor but I could imagine a vert.x blueprint, 
Micro Frontents will be great if we get it right as it is hard to make it good

Modulith -> Better package/module structure, instead by layer by domain
